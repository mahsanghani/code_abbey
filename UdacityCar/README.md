Nanodegree applying computer vision and deep learning to automotive problems, including detecting lane lines, predicting
steering angles, and more. I learned sensor fusion, which was used to filter data from an array of sensors in order to
perceive the environment. The Capstone of the entire Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program is "Carla", the
Udacity self-driving car, and the Robot Operating System that controls her. I worked to combine what I've learned over
the course of the entire Nanodegree Program to run my code on Carla, a real self-driving car.

PART 1  
Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion  
Here, I first become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. I will teach the
car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data, along with working with lidar
and radar data.

PART 2  
Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration  
Here, I expand on my sensor knowledge to localize and control the vehicle. I evaluate sensor data from camera, radar,
lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle, finishing by combining all my skills
on a real self-driving car under system integration!
