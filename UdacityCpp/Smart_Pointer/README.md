# Smart_Pointer

* This project is about implementing a customized garbage collector, by using C++ default pointers. Futher, **
  verification of memory leakage** is provided to confirm the correctness of implementing such a garbage collector.
* In this project, a simple garbage collector pointer class has been implemented. The garbage collector basically uses
  three classes: `Pointer`, `PtrDetails` and `Iter`:
    * `Pointer` is the core garbage collector class, which implements a garbage-collection pointer
    * `PtrDetails` maintains a list reference counts with allocated memory, and bonds a reference count to a piece of
      allocated memory
    * `Iter` is a template class similar in function to an `STL` iterator, and it defines all pointer *operations*,
      including pointer arithmetic, such as `*`, `->`, `begin()`, and `end()`, which work much like their equivalents in
      the `STL`.
